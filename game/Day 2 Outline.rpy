    {color=#34B7EB}The day’s events pretty much flew by in an instant - from the second I woke up to this very moment.

    {color=#34B7EB}Before, in between, and even during my classes, all I could think about was going back to work today. Partially due to excitement of this shift’s prospects and partially due to nervousness, I assume.

    {color=#34B7EB}Regardless, I can say for certain that I’m looking forward to walking through those fancy doors and being greeted by a friendly face.
